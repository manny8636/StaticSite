1.	What did you like about this website?

    I like the vivid images. I like the layout of the “About Us” and “Book Your Vacation” pages. The content is creative across the pages.

2.	Describe one significant difference between your own P1 site and this person's. E.g. 
- Which has a better user experience (and why)?

    I think the images on their site and overall aesthetic would be more pleasant to a desktop visitor, but as the site doesn’t make many accommodations for smaller screens(larger font, drop down page navigation) those visitors may have a better experience on my site. 

2.	Which codebase do you think would be more maintainable (and why)?

    I think their codebase might be harder to maintain because the style is spread throughout the html files instead of organized in a folder of CSS files.

3.	Is the code well-structured within files, and well-organized between files and directories? 

    HTML code is well structured within files. I think placing all CSS code in CSS files that have their own directory would make it easier to track styling across pages. 

4.	Did you find any other issues? If so, briefly enumerate them. 

    Some elements overlapped when the window size was altered drastically.

- were semantically appropriate elements selected?

    Appropriate elements were selected.

2.	is the CSS refactored to limit duplication?

    Much of the CSS applied broadly to elements on each page, but some of the style was repeated for each page. I think there is opportunity to reduce CSS duplication. 

5.	Do you have any other constructive comments for the author?

    The aesthetic and content of the site is great. With a little more organization of style and support for mobile users I think this site could be even better.
