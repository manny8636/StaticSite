        1.) You will create a website with a focused theme and audience of your choosing. Your site might serve a student group, a relative who’s planning a wedding, a business, or an artist who needs a portfolio. The site must serve someone besides yourself. A large part of web design is thinking empathetically, and this requirement makes that explicit.<br>
            * I decided to make a website that lets you pick a location for a vacation from a select list; it is called Vacation Location.<br>
        2.) Your content must be original and not lifted from other websites. Third-party images are acceptable provided you adhere to their license.<br>
            * I picked photos from Google images; I hope that is okay.<br>
        3.) Your site must contain at least five separate pages, each having a meaningful purpose. One of the files should be named index.html, which Apache loads by default.<br>
            * I have a page for the home, about us, booking, browsing locations, and a review page.<br>
        4.) Your site must include some sort of header.<br>
            * My header is Vacation Location (name of the business).<br>
        5.) Your site must include some sort of navigation links.<br>
            * I have a navigation bar at the top of my each of my pages to navigate to each other.<br>        
        7.) Your site must maintain a coherent style across its pages. Repeated style rules must be placed in a shared external stylesheet. Style rules not shared between pages must be placed in separate external stylesheets.<br>
            * I have a style page for repeated code but then a separate style tag with css code specific to each page.<br>
        8.) Your site must include images, and their alt attributes must adequately describe the image content to users of screen readers, user with images disabled, and webcrawlers.<br>
            * My pictures have captions; on the browse page, we tell you the location of the pictures.<br>
        9.) Each page must declare its favicon.<br>
            * My favicon is a palm tree to fit the theme of the website.<br>
        10.) Your site’s non-HTML resources must be organized. Images must be placed in a directory named images. CSS files must be placed in a directory named css. If you include any JavaScript code, these files must be placed in a directory named js.<br>
            * I threw all my photos used on my website into a folder within the project called pics.<br>
        11.) Your site must not be built using any libraries or frameworks. Do not use Bootstrap, jQuery, React, Angular, Vue, or any other third-party tools. You may, however, reimplement the ideas you see in these third-party tools.<br>
            * I did not use any libraries or frameworks that are not allowed.<br>       
        13.) The content should be neatly aligned. The axes of alignment should be clearly visible. Favor left- and right-alignment over centering—as centering does not produce a strong axis of alignment.<br>
            * Website is aligned for the most part.<br>
        14.) The content should have adequate and consistent spacing. Text should never bleed against the edge of its containing box.<br>
            * Text as adequate spacing and does not bleed against edges.<br>
        15.) Your site must use at least two different font faces. Headings are often rendered in a sans-serif font, and paragraph copy in a serif font.<br>
            * I use multiple fonts.<br>
        18.) Your source code must be readable, using conventional and consistent formatting and meaningful names for classes and IDs. Favor kebab-case case identifiers over camelCase.<br>
            * My code is readable and formatted to make it easier for interpreters.<br>
        20.) Your site must be stored in a Git repository that you have shared with your instructor. On GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, share with the user hcientist.<br>
            * My code is backed up to Git repository.<br>
        21.) The names of your files must be entirely lowercase and contain only alphanumeric characters.<br>
            * My file names pass these requirements.<br>
        25.) Your Git repository should show a steady flow of commits over the course of the project. Committing and pushing should happen steadily, after each work session, and not just right before the due date.<br>
            * On github, I have many commits but have only pulled about three times.<br>
        26.)In https://project1.YOUR-DOMAIN-NAME/report.html, write a brief report containing an itemized breakdown of how you believe you have met the expectations listed above.<br>
            * Here is my report (:<br>
